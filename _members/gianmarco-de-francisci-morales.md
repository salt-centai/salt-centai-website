My name is Gianmarco De Francisci Morales and I work as Principal Researcher at CENTAI, where I lead the Social Algorithmics Team (SALT). In the past I worked as Senior Research Scientist at ISI Foundation, Scientist at QCRI, as Visiting Scientist at Aalto University, as Research Scientist at Yahoo Labs, and as Research Associate at the HPC Lab of ISTI-CNR.

I hold a Ph.D. in CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) from IMT Lucca, and Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Engineering from University of Catania.

My main research interests are understanding how controversial topics are discussed online, whether polarization is created or amplified by social media, and in applying computational methods to understand online discussions.
In the past, I also worked on scalable data mining (especially graphs and streams) and data-intensive scalable computing.
